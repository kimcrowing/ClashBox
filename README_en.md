#### Introduction

ClashBox is the first proxy software for the HarmonyOS NEXT platform based on the Navigation framework, using the modified [Mihomo (ClashMeta)](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo) kernel.

Please read the disclaimer and FAQ carefully before use.

#### Software Features

- üíª **Native development**: The front-end is developed using the HarmonyOS native language ArkTS, offering smoother performance and richer animations.  
- ‚ú® **Cool interface**: Built with HarmonyOS NEXT‚Äôs native design style, using a [Surfboard](https://github.com/getsurfboard/surfboard)-like layout. Supports dark mode, blur effects, and more for an enhanced experience.  
- üì± **Multi-device adaptation**: Optimized UI for phones, tablets, foldables, HarmonyOS PCs, and even PuraX external screens*.  
- üöÄ **Stable kernel**: Powered by the well-regarded [Mihomo (ClashMeta)](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo) core, with feature parity and reliable stability.  
- üîÑ **Core recovery**: Because HarmonyOS NEXT‚Äôs background scheduling is still immature, background processes may be killed by the system. ClashBox includes a built-in recovery mechanism that automatically restarts the core process if it‚Äôs terminated (this is automatically enabled when ‚ÄúBackground Run ‚Äì Simulated Picture-in-Picture‚Äù is turned on).  

*The PuraX external screen currently only displays Huawei-whitelisted apps. This app will not be available until it is whitelisted.

#### How to Use

You can install ClashBox using [Auto-installer](https://github.com/likuai2010/auto-installer/) or [DevEcho Testing](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-testing/).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Huawei‚Äôs signing server blocks IP addresses outside mainland China. To sideload HarmonyOS NEXT apps outside of mainland China, please use a proxy or other methods to obtain a mainland China IP address.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Apps sideloaded with self-signed certificates on HarmonyOS NEXT are only valid for 14 days by default. After [developer real-name authentication](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/verified/enrollment), the validity period can be extended to 180 days.  
>  
> Real-name authentication may require a Chinese resident ID card.
